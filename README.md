# stampedearm-armsync
### Master Planning and Brainstorming
**ArmSync** is the software package that interfaces the prosthetic & it's electronics to the Stampede Arm server for updates, diagnostics, debugging and help.

Goals
- [ ] Client Facing - Software should be easy to use for the most basic of customers
- [ ] Cross Platform - MacOSX, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android
- [ ] Agile - Using up-to date, organized, clean code and GUI
- [ ] Tiered UI - Allow super basic interface option to start, with 2-3 levels up that have more complex (and feature filled) interfaces
- [ ] Admin/Client - Method for devs to connect into client software and prosthetic for tuning and advanced control
- [ ] Ideally Web-based - Web based Interface allows for fast, rapid testing and updates while still providing functionality. Additionally, most users will know how to use Chrome or IE and cross-platform testing is simplified. The biggest drawback is interfacing with the actual arm as most browsers don't have simple bluetooth/serial hooks. Possibly adds an actual program to act as the middle man?
